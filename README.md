## Ensuring Functionality and Security  
To make sure my code is both functional and secure, I rely on unit testing to catch edge cases and verify that individual components work as expected. When different parts of the system need to work together, I also do integration testing. On the security side, I stick to basic best practices like sanitizing inputs and limiting access based on need — following the principle of least privilege, which is one of the simplest and most effective ways to reduce risk. I also try to use libraries or tools that are actively maintained and regularly checked for vulnerabilities.

## Interpreting and Incorporating User Needs  
When it comes to meeting user needs, I find that open communication and early clarification make the biggest difference. I try to understand what users are really asking for, and translate that into clear goals for the software. In longer projects, this might mean setting up milestones with specific deliverables; for shorter ones, it could just be making sure everyone agrees on what's expected up front. Either way, it's about aligning the work with real user expectations.

## Approach to Designing Software  
My approach to designing software starts with identifying the core requirements and any constraints. I’ll often sketch out rough designs, flows, or diagrams to get a feel for the structure before coding. I value flexibility and scalability in the design — not just for today, but to make room for future changes. Even when the client isn’t sure yet what else they might need, building with expansion in mind can help avoid major rewrites later on.
